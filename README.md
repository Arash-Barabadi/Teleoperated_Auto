# Teleoperated Auto
## During the last semester, our team successfully completed a Teleoperated Autonomous Vehicle project, working in two specialized groups: hardware and software. Our goal was to develop a system that enables remote control and autonomous operation while ensuring seamless communication between various components.
## I was responsible for designing and implementing the ROS (Robot Operating System) architecture, which served as the foundation for communication between different nodes. My key contributions included:
###    IMU Sensor Node: Developed and integrated the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to provide real-time orientation and motion data for stability and navigation.
###    Motor and Steering Node: Designed and implemented control nodes to handle motor actuation and steering mechanisms, ensuring smooth and responsive movement.

## This collaboration between hardware and software teams allowed us to build a fully functional system that effectively integrates sensor data, motor control, and remote operation. The project was a valuable learning experience, reinforcing the importance of teamwork, system integration, and real-time robotics applications.

## This project provided valuable hands-on experience in robotics, sensor integration, and system communication, helping us bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
