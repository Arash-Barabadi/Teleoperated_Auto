### Arduino boards are on a microcontroller-based platform that program using C++-like programming langauge.
### The version of Arduino that I'm using is Arduino UNO R3. 
### One can program the Arduino board by connecting it to the PC. Then download Arduino IDE. In the windows of IDE one can program like C++. 

### In the Arduino programming language, similiar to C++, there are a lot of libraries available for simplfiying tasks, e.g, libraries for communicating with a PC, sending speed commands to motor drivers and so forth.

# There is also a library for interfacing with ROS2.

### Explanation: In ROS there is a library that enables us to send and receive message from and to a microcontroller, which is rosserial. 
### ROS2, on the other hand, can be equipped with a library that is still recent, but can enable us to do the same thing as on ROS. It is called micro-ROS, this tool will help us achieve what we can do on ROS, like communnicating an Arduino board to a ROS2 PC.
